SpikeReader.py is supposed to be run on the lego spike. Its purpose is 
to accept a json file array with the command we need the spike to run.
Each json file it reads is supposed to be 1 command.
SpikeReader.py uses a tree of if statements to decide on what command to run.
For now, the lego commands are the print statements.
